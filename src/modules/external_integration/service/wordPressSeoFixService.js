/**
 * WordPressSeoFixService (Phase 4, Step 4-9 of the locked architecture)
 *
 * Owns validateFix()/readCurrentValue()/applyFix() for a single, already
 * user-approved WordPress SEO fix. Provider-agnostic on purpose — every
 * `if (provider === ...)` branch lives in the adapters (../adapters/), never
 * here or in the controller. Callers pass an already-loaded, already
 * ownership-checked Task document (see taskController.applyWordPressFix) —
 * this service never loads a Task by a client-supplied ID itself, and never
 * accepts a provider/metaKey/endpoint from the caller: every one of those is
 * derived from the Task's own issueKey + its project's WordPressConnection.
 *
 * Scope: title, meta_description, canonical, robots (post-scoped — see
 * FIELD_CONFIG below), plus same_as and breadcrumb (SITE-scoped — no post
 * ID involved at all, see the `scope: 'site'` branches in validateFix()/
 * readCurrentValue()/applyFix()). See providerCapabilityRegistry.js for
 * the full, current issue -> field capability matrix, including the
 * Organization/Person schema fields intentionally NOT yet wired to an
 * automatable issue. `h1` (issue h1_missing only) is the one PAGE-CONTENT fix:
 * it does not touch an SEO plugin or the Bridge at all — see the `contentChannel`
 * branches and ../content/ (builder adapters, Divi only today). Deliberately
 * excludes `image_alt` (the existing Task/seo_page_issues before-snapshot for
 * `images_missing_alt_text` is not yet confirmed to carry a specific image
 * `src` this service could safely target — see the Phase 4 implementation
 * report's Remaining Limitations; wordpressCoreAdapter.writeAltText already
 * exists and is unit-tested, ready to be wired in once that's resolved).
 * Slug is similarly excluded: wordpressCoreAdapter.writeSlug exists, but
 * issueSnapshotTypes.js (which this service deliberately does not modify)
 * has no 'slug' snapshot type, so TaskVerificationService has no way to
 * verify a slug change — wiring slug in here without that would create a
 * WordPress fix Odito can apply but can never confirm or detect a
 * regression on, which is worse than not offering it yet.
