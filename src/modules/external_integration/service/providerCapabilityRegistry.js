/**
 * ProviderCapabilityRegistry
 *
 * The single source of truth for "which SEO fields can Odito safely
 * automate through the WordPress SEO Bridge, and how." Every other file
 * that needs to know an issue's field type, its WordPress-side name, or how
 * to normalize/validate/compare its value reads from HERE — this is what
 * keeps Rank-Math-specific (or Yoast/AIOSEO/SEOPress-specific) field names
 * out of controllers and out of wordPressSeoFixService.js's own logic.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — this registry does NOT decide whether a given WordPress site
 * currently supports a field; that is a live, per-connection fact reported
 * by the Bridge's own /capabilities endpoint (see oditoSeoBridgeService.js)
 * and depends on which SEO plugin is active there. This registry decides
 * something narrower and static: whether Odito's OWN codebase has a
 * complete, verified write -> read-back -> crawler-verify implementation
 * for a field AT ALL, for ANY provider. A field with `supported: false`
 * here is never offered for auto-apply regardless of what any live site
 * reports, because Odito has no way to safely drive it yet.
 *
 * SCOPE — most fields are `scope: 'post'` (implied — the field omits
 * `scope`), meaning the Bridge writes to one specific WordPress post/page.
 * `scope: 'site'` fields (same_as, breadcrumb_schema) instead write to
 * site-wide WordPress options via the Bridge's /seo/site routes — no post
 * ID is ever resolved or required for these. See
 * wordPressSeoFixService.js's `config.scope === 'site'` branches.
 *
 * HOW same_as/breadcrumb_schema moved from unsupported to supported: real
 * research against the connected naxonify.com Rank Math installation
 * (its actual PHP source, cloned from github.com/rankmath/seo-by-rank-math
 * and read directly — not guessed, and not from secondary documentation)
 * found the exact, confirmed storage mechanism for both:
 *   - Organization/Knowledge Graph fields (including the 3 sources that
 *     compose sameAs: social_url_facebook, twitter_author_names,
 *     social_additional_profiles) live in the `rank-math-options-titles`
 *     WordPress option — confirmed via Rank Math's own
 *     rank-math/set-website-identity ability class.
 *   - The breadcrumbs on/off toggle lives in the `rank-math-options-general`
 *     option's `breadcrumbs` key — confirmed via Rank Math's own
 *     rank-math/set-breadcrumb-settings ability class, and its
 *     JsonLD::can_add_breadcrumb() showing BreadcrumbList output is gated
 *     entirely on this one setting.
 * This is a genuinely new Bridge surface (RankMathProvider::get_site_schema/
 * update_site_schema_field, gated behind manage_options — see
 * class-security.php), not an extension of the per-post one, exactly as
 * anticipated when these were first marked unsupported.
 *
 * `same_as`'s write is narrowly scoped to the social_additional_profiles
 * bucket only — it can never touch/delete the Facebook or Twitter fields, so
 * an existing social profile can never be destroyed through this capability
 * (see RankMathProvider::update_same_as). The URLs are ENTERED BY THE SITE
 * OWNER, never taken from the AI recommendation (which is told to say "not
 * provided in context" rather than invent one): wordPressSeoFixService's
 * applySameAsFix() validates them, merges them one at a time with the
 * existing additional profiles, and reads the result back.
 *
 * Remaining `supported: false` entries and why:
 *
 *   - organization_schema (name/url/logo/description as INDIVIDUAL fixable
 *     fields): the write mechanism itself IS implemented and unit-tested
 *     (RankMathProvider::update_site_schema_field handles all four), but no
 *     current Odito issue exposes a safely automatable SINGLE-VALUE fix for
 *     it — the `organization_schema` issue's own recommendation format is a
 *     full multi-field description ("Organization schema with name, url,
 *     logo, address, telephone, sameAs, @id" — see SchemaResolver.js),
 *     not a single string. Applying it safely would mean either splitting
 *     that issue into one-field-per-issue codes (a Python-side audit rule
 *     change, out of scope here) or restructuring the Recommendation model
 *     to carry multiple fields at once (explicitly out of scope: "do not
 *     create another Task/Recommendation model"). sameas_array is the one
 *     Organization-schema-adjacent issue with a genuinely single-value,
 *     safely automatable shape, and IS supported.
 *   - person_schema: rendered from the POST'S AUTHOR'S WordPress user
 *     account (@id is the author archive URL, e.g.
 *     https://naxonify.com/author/<slug>/) — i.e. PER-USER data (a `name`
 *     from wp_users.display_name, a `description` from user meta, a
 *     `sameAs` from THREE user meta keys), not site-wide options and not
 *     post meta. Automating this safely requires resolving post_author from
 *     the post, verifying that user belongs to the same site, and — most
 *     importantly — a genuinely new PERMISSION model (editing another
 *     user's profile fields requires WordPress's edit_users capability,
 *     which the Bridge's existing edit_post-based per-post check and its
 *     manage_options-based site check both under- or over-specify). This is
 *     real, buildable, confirmed-storage-format work, deliberately deferred
 *     to keep this pass's blast radius (and its live-testing risk against a
 *     real user account) contained — not a guess or an oversight.
 *
 * faq_schema IS supported, through a different mechanism than the fields
 * above (and than Rank Math's own FAQ block, which lives in the post BODY as
 * serialized Gutenberg markup — editing that is arbitrary content replacement,
 * which this project's non-goals exclude). Instead the Bridge owns a small,
 * dedicated per-post store: it validates a FAQPage JSON-LD object, keeps only
 * its Question/Answer pairs in one post-meta key of its own, and renders the
 * JSON-LD in wp_head. That never touches post content or any SEO plugin's
 * data, works whichever SEO plugin (or none) is active, and is fully
 * read-back-able and verifiable: the crawler's own `structured_data` for the
 * page is compared, pair by pair, to the pairs the schema was generated from
 * (which are themselves only ever the FAQ pairs the crawler saw on the page —
 * see faqSchema.js). Odito's own writes are limited to that one key, so
 * removing the schema is a matter of removing that key.
