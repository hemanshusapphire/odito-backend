/**
 * TaskVerificationService
 *
 * Runs exactly once per verification batch (chainingEngine gates the call
 * behind allTerminalsResolved — see P3-002/Part 3) — a full project recrawl
 * and a single-page URL Verification run both end in the same completion
 * hook, so both trigger task re-verification identically. Compares
 * implemented/reopened tasks against the latest OPEN issues (seo_page_issues
 * is now a reconciled current-issue snapshot, P3-002) to determine whether
 * the issue is actually fixed on the website.
 *
 * Presence/absence (is the issue_code still open?) remains the authoritative
 * signal for reopened/verified — it already reflects the Python-side
 * lifecycle reconciliation. Layered on top, for the 5 issue types that get a
 * real captured expected-fix-value (title, meta description, h1, image alt,
 * canonical — see TaskHistoryService/issueSnapshotTypes), verification also
 * re-resolves the actual current value from seo_page_data and records
 * whether it matched — a `method: 'value_diff'` result the UI can show with
 * real confidence, vs. `'presence_fallback'` everywhere else. See
 * issueSnapshotTypes.js for the full, current list of snapshot types.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   IMPLEMENTED    → recheck → issue gone?  → VERIFIED_FIXED
 *                            → issue exists? → REOPENED
 *   REOPENED       → recheck → issue gone?  → VERIFIED_FIXED
 *                            → issue exists? → REOPENED (unchanged)
 *   VERIFIED_FIXED → recheck → issue gone?  → VERIFIED_FIXED (unchanged)
 *                            → issue exists? → REOPENED (Phase 3 — previously
 *                              terminal; a regression on an already-verified
 *                              issue is now detected instead of silently
 *                              never being re-examined again)
