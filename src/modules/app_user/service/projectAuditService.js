 *     data is reset. The reservation is a single $expr-guarded update, so two
 *     simultaneous requests can never consume more than the allowance.
 *   - If the run fails to START (reset/job creation throws) the reservation is
 *     refunded and the lock released, mirroring project creation's refund
 *     precedent. Once jobs exist there is no automatic refund — pipeline
 *     failures, worker crashes and page refreshes do not return the credit.
