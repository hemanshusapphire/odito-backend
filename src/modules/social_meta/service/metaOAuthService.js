/**
 * MetaOAuthService — the Meta-specific half of the OAuth flow: building
 * the consent URL and exchanging an authorization code for an access
 * token. Graph API HTTP mechanics (base URL, version, timeout, error
 * normalization) are metaApiService.js's job; this file only knows the
 * OAuth-specific endpoints and parameters.
 *
 * Phase 1 scope: token EXCHANGE only. Nothing here persists a token —
 * that's explicitly deferred to Phase 2 (SocialAccount model) per the
 * spec for this phase. The exchanged token is handed back to the
 * controller, which currently does nothing with it but confirm the
 * exchange succeeded.

// Permissions required for the Page + Instagram connection, analytics
// read, AND publishing flows. Facebook/Page permissions first, Instagram
// permissions grouped afterward.
//
// pages_manage_posts / instagram_content_publish were added when the
// Social Publishing feature (SocialPublication, platformAdapters/) was
// built — this scope list previously only covered the read/analytics
// flows and deliberately left publishing for "later." That "later" was
// never done: every Facebook Page connected under the OLD scope list has
// a token that can read but cannot post, which live-testing against the
// real Graph API confirmed directly (POST /{pageId}/feed on an existing
// connection fails with OAuthException code 200, "requires ...
// pages_manage_posts permission"). Adding the scope here only affects
// NEW connections — every account connected before this change must be
// disconnected and reconnected for its token to actually carry the new
// permission; this file cannot retroactively upgrade an already-issued
// token's grants.
//
// ROOT CAUSE of the "Invalid Scopes: instagram_business_basic,
// instagram_business_manage_insights" rejection this app hit: Meta splits
// Instagram integration into two entirely separate products, each with its
// OWN authorization host and its OWN scope namespace —
//   - "Instagram API with FACEBOOK Login" (Instagram professional account
//     must be linked to a Facebook Page — this is Odito's whole Phase 1-3
//     architecture: Page discovery via /me/accounts, Page token reused for
//     Instagram) -> authorization host www.facebook.com/{version}/dialog/oauth
//     -> scope namespace: instagram_basic, instagram_manage_insights,
//     instagram_manage_comments, instagram_content_publish (classic
//     "instagram_" prefix, NOT "instagram_business_").
//   - "Instagram API with INSTAGRAM Login" (no Facebook Page at all —
//     Instagram accounts connect directly) -> authorization host
//     www.instagram.com/oauth/authorize -> scope namespace: the
//     "instagram_business_*" names.
// instagram_business_basic / instagram_business_manage_insights are ONLY
// ever valid on www.instagram.com/oauth/authorize — never on
// www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth, which is the endpoint buildAuthorizationUrl()
// below actually calls. That's why the previous change to the
// "instagram_business_*" names was rejected: it wasn't a typo, it was the
// wrong product's namespace for this app's flow. Confirmed against Meta's
// current official documentation (developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-
// platform/instagram-api-with-facebook-login/business-login-for-instagram/),
// not assumed. Do not reintroduce the instagram_business_* names unless
// Odito's OAuth flow is deliberately migrated to Instagram Login (a much
// larger change — different host, different token-exchange endpoint, and
// no Facebook Page in the flow at all — not something to do silently by
// renaming scopes).
//
// read_insights is also deliberately absent — it does not appear in Meta's
// documented scope list for this flow either.

 * session/grant. Without it, a user who already authorized this app once
 * will often be silently redirected straight back with a fresh code and
 * NO new consent screen at all — meaning a scope added to
 * META_OAUTH_SCOPES after the fact (like pages_manage_posts) can
 * silently never actually be granted no matter how many times "Connect"
 * is clicked. This is a real, live-confirmed root cause: every
 * previously-connected Page's token in this system still lacks
 * pages_manage_posts even after the scope list was fixed, because
 * nothing ever forced Meta to re-prompt for it.
 *
 * Deliberately opt-in, not the default — forcing re-consent on every
 * normal "Connect" would be a needless extra click for a brand-new
 * connection that was never going to skip the dialog anyway.
 * `auth_type` is a genuine, Meta-documented parameter (not invented) —
 * only 'rerequest' is supported here, the exact value Meta's own docs
